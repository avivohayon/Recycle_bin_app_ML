# Recycle Bin Classifier

## Introduction
Have you ever needed to throw the garbage with the intention of recycling it, only to realize there are no labels for the content of the bin? That's exactly what happened to me! Inspired by this experience, I developed the Recycle Bin Classifier, a full-stack application that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to classify the type of recycle bin in real-time. This project not only showcases my expertise in Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and React Native but also highlights my commitment to creating a positive impact in the world.

## About the Project
The Recycle Bin Classifier aims to tackle the global issue of waste management by providing users with real-time information about the type of recycle bin they encounter. With the power of computer vision and deep learning, this application can accurately identify the bin's category and inform users about the appropriate items they can dispose of.

## Key Technologies Used
- Backend: Python with TensorFlow and Keras
- Cloud Deployment: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
- Frontend: React Native

## Project Highlights
During the development of this application, I leveraged Python along with the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build and train a convolutional neural network. This model achieves high accuracy in classifying recycle bins, empowering users to make informed decisions about recycling. By deploying the trained model to the cloud using GCP, the application ensures reliable and scalable performance.

On the frontend, I utilized React Native to create an intuitive and user-friendly mobile app. From designing the interface to implementing features like fetching data with Axios, I aimed to deliver a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
## Community Impact

This project goes beyond technological innovation; it addresses a pressing environmental issue and contributes to building a better community. By empowering users with knowledge about appropriate waste disposal, the Recycle Bin Classifier encourages responsible recycling practices, leading to a cleaner and more sustainable environment.
