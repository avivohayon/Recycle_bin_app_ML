# Recycle bin app ML

Have you ever needed to throw the garbage with the intention of recycling it, only to realize there are no labels for the content of the bin? That's exactly what happened to me! So, I built my own full-stack recycling bin application that allows you to classify, in real-time, the type of recycling bin you are looking at and displays all the garbage you can throw into it! I achieved this by building my own convolutional neural network (using TensorFlow and Keras), uploading the model to GCP, and creating an Android app using React Native.


## Backend

- python
- Tensorflow and Kears
- GCP

## FrontEnd
- React Natvie
